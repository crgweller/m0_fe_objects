# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

Figuring out all the syntax stuff took some time. As usual I was making it too complicated.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I had better notes for things like showing lists of values that I could reference quickly, which was really helpful.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

This time around it was running things in replit and making small changes so I could troubleshoot each time something wasn't working. Allowed for faster iterations with some semblance of meaningful feedback.
